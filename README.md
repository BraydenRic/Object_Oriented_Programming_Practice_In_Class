# Object-Oriented Programming in C++

Welcome to my C++ code repository showcasing various examples of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. These programs cover essential OOP principles such as classes, objects, constructors, operator overloading, inheritance, encapsulation, dynamic memory allocation, and more. Each code example is designed to demonstrate specific OOP concepts using C++.

## Introduction

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular programming paradigm that focuses on creating and modeling real-world entities as objects. These objects have attributes (data members) and behaviors (member functions) and are organized into classes. This repository contains various C++ code examples that illustrate OOP concepts and demonstrate how to implement them in practice.

## Classes and Objects

- Definition and implementation of classes.
- Creation of objects and member variables.
- Access specifiers (private and public) to control member accessibility.

## Constructors and Destructors

- Default constructor and parameterized constructor.
- Copy constructor for object initialization.
- Destructor to release memory resources.

## Operator Overloading

- Overloading arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to perform operations on custom objects.
- Overloading comparison operators (>, ==) to compare objects.
- Overloading prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators (++ and --) for custom behavior.

## Friend Functions

- Use of friend functions to allow non-member functions access to private members of a class.

## Encapsulation

- Encapsulation of data and behavior within class methods.
- Data hiding and encapsulation of member variables using private access specifiers.

## Member Functions

- Definition and implementation of member functions to perform operations on objects.

## Dynamic Memory Allocation

- Usage of dynamic memory allocation (new/delete) to manage objects' memory.

## Input/Output Operator Overloading

- Overloading input and output stream operators (<< and >>) to enable custom input and output operations.

## Conversion Functions

- Creating conversion functions to convert Roman numerals to decimal numbers and vice versa.

## Conditional Statements and Loops

- Use of conditional statements (if-else) to perform specific actions based on conditions.
- Use of loops (for, while) to iterate over strings and arrays.

## C++ Standard Library

- Utilization of standard library functions (e.g., strcpy, strlen, strcmp) for string manipulation.
- Usage of standard library containers (e.g., string, ostream, istream) and algorithms.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`or simply download `.zip file`.
2. Navigate to the directory of the desired C++ file in your terminal.
3. Compile the C++ file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++). For example:
4. Run the compiled executable to see the output of the program.
